-- | Unfolder episode 25: from Java to Haskell
--
-- In this episode, we will translate a gRPC server written in Java to Haskell.
-- We will use it as an example to demonstrate some of the conceptual
-- differences of the two languages, but also observe that the end result of the
-- translation looks perhaps more similar to the Java version than one might
-- expect. Unlike most of our episodes, we hope that this one is understandable
-- to any software developer, even people without any previous exposure to
-- Haskell. Of course, we wonâ€™t be able to explain everything, but the example
-- used should help to establish an idea of the look and feel of Haskell code,
-- and perhaps learn a bit more about the relationship between the
-- object-oriented and functional programming paradigms.

    in Java, but this is just different library design.
